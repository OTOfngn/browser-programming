## 2. Semantic decisions I made (REQUIRED)

Explain at least **three semantic choices** you made in your HTML.

### Decision 1
- Element(s) used: section
- Where in the page: body
- Why this element is semantically correct: It's meaningful as real sections instead of divs.

### Decision 2
- Element(s) used: heading fonts
- Where in the page: Head, body
- Why this element is semantically correct: It distinguish itself from normal texts.

### Decision 3
- Element(s) used: head, body and footer
- Where in the page: All over the page
- Why this element is semantically correct: It divides the page into three reasonable parts.
